**1. Basic information:**

  A Class-C VCO acheving a jitter-powe FoM of -190 dB in simulation, and -186.4 in measurment, at 10-MHz offset frequency.
  
  The VCO is used in our CICC 2024 paper: A 20-24-GHz DPSSPLL with Charge-Domain Bandwidth Optimization Scheme Achieving 61.3-fs RMS Jitter and -253-dB FoMJitter.

**2. Expected results in ADE after performing the simulation:**
